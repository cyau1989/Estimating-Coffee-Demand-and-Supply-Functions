# Estimating-Coffee-Demand-and-Supply-Functions
The paper seeks to estimate the coffee demand and supply functions and estimate the significant factors concerning the demand and supply function by using consumption and production data from the Dutch coffee market. We estimate the linear and logarithmic model by assuming the roasted coffee price is at market equilibrium. Our results indicate that mainly the bean price and income explain the movement of the roasted coffee price. We observed that tea is not viewed as a close substitute good of coffee, and suppliers tend to absorb the increment of other costs to stabilize the market price, thus making other costs less correlated with the market price.
